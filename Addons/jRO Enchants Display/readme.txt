### jRO Enchantments
kRO doesn't have these Enchantment Prefixes like jRO has, so I made it optionally via seperate folder.

In case you don't know what I mean with `Enchantment Prefixes`:
- Enchantments are like Cards, but for kRO they don't have any entries in these files, so they won't be recognized as such.
- jRO on the other hand, added Prefixes for them to show like `<Fighting Spirit7>` for ID 4822 in the Item Name, just like Cards.

You are free to choose what you want to do with it.

It should be self-explanatory how to use these files.
