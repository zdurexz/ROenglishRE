ML_SPIRALPIERCE#
Spiral Pierce
Max Level: 5
Skill Form: ^FF0000Physical attack ^000000
Description: ^777777Extend your spear, and spin it in a spiral fashion to increase overall damage and ability to pierce. A more powerful version of Pierce which ignores Def and Vit Def and also stun-locks your opponent for 3 sec.
Damage is (100+50*SkillLV)% damage. The attack is 5 hits with the damage divided evenly between the hits. However you can increase damage further by increasing the weight of your weapon (upgrades count too! LV 1 weapons +10/upgrade, LV 2 weapons +15/upgrade, LV 3 weapons +25/upgrade).
Although damage will increase with better skill level, so will the Cast Time / Cool Down. Aura Blade does not add damage to this skill. Recent tests revealed the following (rather complex) formula:
[(80% of weapons weight times (100%+level*50%) + (round.down(Str/10^2) + Upgrade Damage) * size modifier (small 125%, medium 100%, large 75%)) * card factors (+20% and such) * element factors ]* 5 hits ^000000

MER_KYRIE#
Kyrie Eleison
Max Level: 10
Skill Form: ^339900Active ^000000
Description: ^777777Creates a Kyrie Eleison effect on the target character. This effect will block MaxHPofTarget*(10+2*SkillLV)% damage OR (5+SkillLV/2) hits, whichever is reached first.
Damage in excess of the amount blocked will transfer through and count as a hit of lowered damage. Hits are only assessed when a blow would normally land and not for every swing by a monster (despite showing an "Auto Guard" graphic with every swing for the effected player and a miss for every other player).
Any Magic attack will do full damage to the affected target, while still counting against the maximum damage and number of hits of Kyrie Eleison. Casting Holy Light or Assumptio on someone with this effect will cancel it entirely. When a second instance is cast on a target, then it will replace the first instance. ^000000
